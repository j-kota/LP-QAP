# LP-QAP
Structured prediction of graph matching permutations using spectral graph theory

This project extends the work of Alex Nowak et. al. in 'A Note on Learning Algorithms for Quadratic Assignment with Graph Neural Networks'
Data generation routines and some aspects of the model are borrowed directly from their public repo
